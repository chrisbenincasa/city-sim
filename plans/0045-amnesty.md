# 0045 — The amnesty

**Read this, not the board. The only thing in flight.**

Opened 2026-08-26. Expires **2026-10-07**. One page, and it stays one page.



---

## The situation

**1.17M words of prose against 17,872 lines of executable simulation.** 169 ADRs, one per 106 lines,
30 of them in five days. **236 of 524 commits changed no code.**

Nobody ages, is born or dies. Wages are unbuilt, so money flows one way into Businesses. Every
shipped world decays. No renderer, no plan for one. The corpus grows with elapsed time and has no
sink — `adr/0006`, violated by its citers.

---

## Standing orders

Until this expires:

1. **No new ADRs.** `CorpusBudgetTests` reddens the build if `docs/adr/` passes 169.
2. **No new entries in `plans/0002` §A–§F.** Frozen at its 2026-08-26 size.
3. **No corpus growth.** `docs/` + `plans/` capped at their 2026-08-26 count.
4. **`adr/0043` and `adr/0052` are suspended.** Choose numbers by taste, stamp them `PROVISIONAL`,
   open no §D row, name no ratifier. *Ratification needs a city and the city needs the numbers, so
   they now prevent every commitment, not only premature ones.*
5. **A session ending with no change under `src/` is not committed.**

To break one, delete its test in a commit saying why — visible, not hard.

## Definition of done, amended

Hexadecimal was satisfying `CLAUDE.md`'s *"something to look at"*.

> **Done means you watched it and were surprised.**

## The queue

Ordered; reordering deletes this.

| | Work | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `CorpusBudgetTests`, this page, the `CLAUDE.md` pointer | ✅ 26-08 |
| 2 | Write `Citizens.Activity` — saved, hashed, per-Tick, **no writer** | ✅ 26-08 |
| 3 | `--day` — one Citizen, one Day, off `Evidence.OfCitizen` | ✅ 26-08 |
| 4 | ~~Nobody comes home~~ — misread; real defect fixed | ✅ 27-08 |
| 5 | ~~Held parking drifts upward~~ — a ramp, not a drift; `ParkingLongRunTests` owns it | ✅ 27-08 |
| 6 | ~~Wages~~ — `waged.toml`; arrears got a sink | ✅ 27-08 |
| 7 | Life Stages and self-generation — [`0046`](0046-life-stages-and-a-self-generating-population.md) | 🟡 scoped |

Items 2 and 3 cost one day and added no Ruleset key, number or ADR. They moved three golden
baselines: a hashed column stopped being zero (`adr/0100`).

## What `--day` found

🔴 ***Nobody comes home* was WRONG** — 468 arrive home a Day; that came off a midnight sample.

**The real defect:** 163 Citizens a Day set off *home* from home, 69 *for work* from work.
`CommuteEngine.Travel` walked both roster lists and never asked where the person was, so **a quarter
of this city's commuting went to where the Citizen already stood.** Invisible until `Activity` had a
writer: home-to-home is a Trip like any other. `CommuteDirectionTests` holds it.

⚠ **It failed three other tests, none a regression**: one horizon too short, two bands calibrated on
phantom traffic. ***Figures off those instruments before 2026-08-27 were partly paid for by a
defect.***
